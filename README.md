My personal implementations for
[Advent of Code (AoC)](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Instructions

The code is designed to take input from `stdin`. A wrapper program *run_day.sh*
exists to run code from the *inputs/* directory.

### Running a single day

```
./run_day.sh 1
```

### Running all days

```
./run_day.sh
```

### Running custom input

```
cargo run -- 01 < <INPUT>
```
